# Submeter Observations of the Cygnus Loop

## Project Abstract
The goal of this project is to study the most prominent regions of the Cygnus Loop using submeter-scale aperture telescopes, primarily utilizing remote observatory tasking and with support by open-source FITS files.

## Open-Source vs Tasked FITS
Image files will be compared between tasked FITS files dfrom submeter telescopes, and Open-Source FITS files from observatories worldwide. Currently, we plan to use the following:
- Alnitak Observatory A1 CDK17 (Remote Tasking)
- Montgomery College On-Site Celestron 11" Optical Tubes (Tasked)
- Hubble FITS (Open-SOurce)

In progress is a script to compress FITS files with RICE1 so they can be uploaded here, said script will also be uploaded alongside. This will not be mentioned in the paper.
